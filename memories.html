            Ackork, we cannot thank God enough for making you our father. You
            are undoubtedly the best dad God could give us. Thank you for
            teaching us to always do the right thing. We have learnt from you to
            keep counting our blessings as that has been your approach to life
            and we have great life lessons on that. You are selfless to a fault
            being selfless even at your age. You still live by the Rotary Club
            motto “Service above self”. Your unwritten motto has always been “no
            problem” and nothing has ever been a problem no matter how much
            financial and physical commitment was involved. All the good moments
            you gave us driving us to birthday parties and patiently waiting for
            us to have more fun while other parents grumbled made you our angel.
            You amazingly managed all your many roles and groups, Rotary Club,
            Chairperson of the Presby Book Depot Board, Session Member/Head of
            Finance Kaneshie Church and District, Founding Member of the Presby
            Foundation, Mamfe fekuw, Teacher and Examiner Institute of Chartered
            Accountants Ghana, Hour of Visitation (HOVCEA) Choir and many more
            but would attend every family event (bearing a worthy donation).
            What better example would we need in father? I, Afua, remember the
            enjoyable excellent rides to and from Mfantseman Girls’ Secondary
            School while I was a student. Thank you for all the educational
            support you gave me till I obtained my Masters in Marketing
            Management from the University of Southampton, UK. I, Amponsaa, am
            eternally grateful for teaching me to drive SWIFTLY with ease and
            dexterity. Thanks for giving me driving tips even to this day. Thank
            you for nurturing me to become a Chartered Accountant by age 23.
            Thank you for the friendship and support. You have always been our
            pillar and even more after our mother Ab left us about 15 years ago.
            Though you were 80 years old then, you would sometimes join our
            children and us for medical appointments. These are only a few
            highlights of our life together. God bless you now and always
            Ackork.

            day, but I couldn’t possibly get you a gift that would live up to
            the one you have already given me! Kukua is life’s greatest gift,

            Grandpa is a caring man. When he was younger/stronger he used to buy
            us Tampico and biscuits. He is very caring. He is as caring as his
            late sister Grandma Auntie Ama who used to bring us snacks after
            school. This was called ‘den na w’afa ba’ in our broken twi then.
            The name was because when we got to the car the first thing we would
            say was ‘den na w’afa ba’ supposed to mean what did you bring?
            Grandpa will always check if we have eaten and is always looking for

            massive blessing due to your tireless effort in bringing us

            Kwaku of blessed memory to persuade his sons, four of them to read
            accounting due to its many benefits. Due to your mentorship as a
            renowned Chartered Accountant, all four of them read Accounting

            to know whether we were related. My answering in the affirmative
            brought the question quoted at the at the beginning of this

            ourselves in. This has helped us in our daily lives till now. Your

            There are too many things so I will be brief. It is through his love
            and dedication to the Lord that I also dedicated my life to serve
            the Lord. His love for music encouraged me to learn how to play the
            guitar so that I could also use it to praise the Lord. He gave me
            his own guitar which was the one I used until I was able to buy mine
            later. His faith and love for the Lord continues to challenge me to
            seek to know the Lord better with each passing day and I am grateful
            for that. On a jovial note, I have not forgotten what he said about
            my beard and moustache at lunch one day in North Labone when I had
            just started to grow one and it was scattered. It caused everyone at
            the table including myself to laugh for a while before we continued
            with eating.

            There are two main remarkable things Paa Offei has done for me which
            have left indelible marks on my life. On the 28th of July 1979, he
            lent us his Benz car no AC 1927 for our wedding. He also once paid
            my daughter Nsoroma’s ACCA examination fees without being asked.
            With his great sense of humour, he has always been a source of
            medicine for me. Proverbs 17:22 - A cheerful heart is good medicine,
            but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.

            Paa Offei
            <br />
            What do I remember of the youngest of our daddies? Growing up in
            Mamfe as a little boy, I remember them all coming and going but
            always, whoever came to visit would make sure that he had seen all
            of us the nieces and nephews. One of my recollections of Paa Offei
            was when I was in Presec and he had to drop me at school on one such
            occasion. The thrill of the ride down the mountains and from Ayi
            Mensah to Mile 9 has remained with me ever since. I don’t quite
            remember whether he was in his Mercedes or the official car – BMW.
            In any case, arriving at school in a smashing car did put my stock
            up then. Fast forward to the late 70’s and early 80’s when I was in
            medical school. He would always encourage me to stop by Cocoa House
            for a little something (pocket money and the ubiquitous golden tree
            chocolate). You can well imagine the number of visitors to my room
            each time I returned from any such visit. It was after completion of
            my house job that I really came to appreciate his interest in my
            career. At the time I was not sure what to do next as going to
            Nigeria, the obvious choice then, had become less attractive. While
            struggling with my decision, he on his own secured an appointment
            for me at 37 Military Hospital, including an offer to stay with him
            till my accommodation was sorted out. Being an Aluta graduate, I
            politely declined and rather took an appointment at Bawku Hospital.
            Knowing how he operates; I went through the application and
            interview completely on his blind side although he was then the
            Financial Controller/Treasurer at the Presby Church Head Office.
            When I went to inform him that I was going to work at Bawku, he was
            very much delighted especially when I told him that I had finished
            with all the interviews and had my appointment letter. He gave me my
            first pay even before I got to Bawku saying I needed to have
            something on me before I received my salary (I took up appointment
            at the beginning of January). And he added clearly that the money
            was not paid back. When in Bawku, I fell ill and had to come down to
            recuperate, he again accommodated me for all the 4 months or so that
            I had to be away from work. While in Bawku, 27 Mankralo Street was
            home each time I came down and it was therefore not surprising that
            it was from here that I got married in 1989. The pieces of advice on
            chatting with him while watching the news on TV or on a ride have
            been invaluable. We thank the Lord for having him to guide us over
            the years. And also, for bringing him to this advanced age of 95
            years.

            Papa Koram affectionately known as Ackork by his children (both
            biological and adopted) is the most selfless person you can ever
            meet in God’s green earth. His nature, personality and love for man
            is all there for everyone to see so I wouldn’t talk about that. I
            will talk about his great sense of humour which even at his age of
            95 we enjoy. I also credit him with my profession and who I am, as
            he was able to change my mind with one sentence. At an early age I
            wanted to become a lawyer, after trying hard to convince me to
            become an accountant and realized I was budging, he just teased “In
            America they call lawyers ambulance chasers”. I thought that was
            below the belt. As if that wasn’t discouraging enough, he asked me
            to work in his office, I had then started going out with my wife
            Christine (now married for 35 years and counting). Christine would
            usually leave work and come and meet me so that we could go to Ghana
            films or somewhere. At about 5.30pm this my old man “Ackork” would
            then walk in to check what I had done for the day. Though Christine
            would be at the reception waiting, Ackork would say “Yεyε ako si ti”
            (we need to finish all the work) then, I thought these two love
            birds want to go out and have fun, but Papa says no. It was all for
            a good cause, because he gave me very good work ethics, the benefits
            I started reaping when I qualified as a Chartered Accountant as he
            wanted me to be. Papa, I am glad that at your age of 95, you are
            here for me to say “thank you’’ to. You are best dad in the world.

            For us Grandpa has always been around since we were born. Grandpa
            has always been our biggest "SPONSOR" from after church snacks at
            Kaneshie Presby to ordering Chinese or Papaye on our birthdays, to
            paying for our church camps and the random gifts and monies. Grandpa
            our favourite musician and the first person to teach us about money
            and accounts. No wonder two of us are in the finance world. Growing
            up, Grandpa collected coins and always allowed us count them. When
            the coin box was full, he always gave us the coins to count and
            after gave them to us. Grandpa reinforced Christianity in all of us
            from an early age. We always liked going to church with Grandpa well
            mostly because of the snacks we would always get after church
            service😂😂 (meat pie, nkati cake, kube toffee and Fanta). We would
            always study hard because every term Grandpa would see our reports
            and we wanted to impress him because good performance came with
            gifts and praises. Even at the university we still did this. We
            would come home and open our school online platform showing grandpa
            how well we did. Grandpa has always supported us in all things. Be
            it educational, religious or personal lives. We are so excited that
            Grandpa has turned 95. Like we say " Grandpa you know our deal, 100
            years o". We are grateful to the Almighty God for his life. We
            cannot wait for 100 years already. We love you Grandpa from Akosua

            Growing up I anytime I saw my Grandpa I was happy because he always
            came along with so many goodies. He was my defender anytime Grandma
            tried to scold me. He would say “Gyae abofra no na wo nso w’ayε bi a
            da”, but later we would have a low key private talk and he would ask
            me to behave. He would always give me money every time I visited
            East Cantonments and encouraged me to get a Masters and a PhD so
            that he can hang my certificates in the living room. Grandpa, as we

            I am grateful to God that I am able to say a few words about Papa
            while he is still alive and can read this to know how much I
            appreciate him for being a blessing to my family and I. I met Papa,
            affectionately called Ackork about 16 years ago when my family and I
            had come to his house to formerly inform him and his wife, Sister
            Abena of blessed memory, of the intention of my son Nana to marry
            their daughter Kuukuwaa. Papa was very friendly and we chatted as
            though we had known each other before then. From that day, we become
            closely knit together as one family. Papa has such a good sense of
            humour; always cracking jokes making all around him laugh. One joke
            I heard from him is “ABEDNEGO” yaba na yɛ bɛ k⊃. Ackork really has a
            heart of gold, kind and caring to a fault. He always asks when I
            visit them “Auntie Gladys w’adidi?”and when I am with other family
            members “Wenchi fo no adi di” with him providing us special desert
            and massage creams as needed. It is my prayer that God will give
            Papa many more healthy years so that his grandchildren and all of us
            can enjoy his company. I always enjoy his conversations centred on
            God and his faithfulness and I appreciate his belief in the power of
            prayer. “Me konk⊃n h⊃. Mo mpaebo no nti me te ase. Nyame ahwɛ me
            so”. Papa as we celebrate your 95th birthday, I wish you God’s
            blessings beyond measure.

          <p>
            I first met Mr. Emmanuel Koram when I was admitted to membership of
            the Rotary Club of Accra in 1973. Rotary is the largest humanitarian
            service organization in the world which has at its base development
            of acquaintance as an opportunity for service. Thus through Rotary I
            started a long relationship with Mr. Koram. His election as club
            secretary in 1978, when I served as President, brought us closely
            together. At this time in particular, we benefited from his
            professionalism and experience which helped to strengthen the club.
            After some years as a member of the Rotary Club of Accra, other
            compelling demands on his time forced him to direct his interests
            elsewhere, but in his heart he remained a Rotarian. Later our paths
            would cross again, when on the establishment of my company in 1990,
            I discovered Mr. Koram was running his private accountancy practice
            in the same building at Adabraka, Accra. Unsurprisingly on being
            approached to provide accounting services to my company, he readily
            agreed without any hesitation whatsoever. He helped to develop
            systems and procedures, checks and balances. He performed his roles
            as accountants to the company so efficiently over the many years
            such that we never encountered any problems whatsoever with our
            auditors or statutory bodies. He also graciously served as a
            Director for several years. During my relationship with Emmanuel, I
            have known him to be highly professional, meticulous, ethical and
            friendly. I always enjoy his company, whether official or social. On
            the occasion of his 95th Birthday, I would like to thank him most
            sincerely for all the services he rendered to me and my company and
            especially for his friendship. Emmanuel, may the good Lord continue
            to grant you many more happy and healthy years and may you continue
            to age gracefully.

            W⊃fa Koram is celebrating his 95th birthday, today, 25 September
            2022 and I have the profound pleasure of writing a few notes from my
            relationship with him, vis-à-vis the establishment of the Cocoa
            Marketing Company of Ghana, the Marketing Subsidiary Company of the
            then Cocoa Marketing Board (CMB) now COCOBOD. Until 1961. Ghana
            cocoa was sold in the UK by its Subsidiary Company, Ghana Cocoa
            Marketing Company (UK) Limited at Chancery Lane in London under the
            leadership of Sir Eric Tansley, Managing Director and Nana Kankan
            Boadu, Managing Director. In 1961 with the decision of Dr. Kwame
            Nkrumah to move the Marketing wing of CMB to Ghana, Mr. Harry Dodoo
            the then Chief Executive Officer of the Ghana CMB was tasked to
            register a new company, the Cocoa Marketing Company (Ghana) Limited.
            W⊃fa, as a newly qualified Chartered Accountant was engaged as the
            Accountant/Secretary while I, as a newly qualified Chartered
            Secretary, was engaged as his assistant. Mr. Koram earned the name
            “W⊃fa” out of the respect and dignity the whole staff had for him.
            W⊃fa Koram and I got on well from the start and are still
            affectionate with each other.

            Uncle Offei was truly a best friend to my father whom he fondly

            visiting Uncle Offei Kwasi when we were younger and later, he
            visited Daddy every Sunday after church. Initially he drove himself
            and then later had to be driven. He always came and when he did not,
            he apologized. Daddy was always happy to see him, and they always
            joked together. I also always enjoy visiting Uncle as he also
            advises me on many things in my marriage and my accounts 😂. It is
            always great to listen to him play his harmonica ❤️ It is always a

          <p>
            My Life with Mr. E. O. Koram (aka Paa Offei in the Koram family) I
            had the opportunity to meet Paa Offei for the first time at Cocoa
            House, Accra when he was the Director of Finance at the Ghana Cocoa
            Board. I had then finished sixth form in 1979 and without much
            vision considered looking for a job and was introduced to him by
            Lawyer Amoh, a working colleague of his at COCOBOD who happens to be
            my Auntie's husband. At his office he asked me few questions about
            Auditing, a sort of informal interview for a few minutes. At the end
            of our conversation, he told me, to quote him, "k⊃ sukuu na woyε
            adwuma seesei a w⊃ bε sisi wo" translated thus “I should further my
            education since that would benefit me more than getting employed at
            the time”. He then said he would give me a job to do (privately) to
            have some pocket money and also to give me a letter to register with
            the Institute of Chartered Accountants Ghana (ICAG) and attend
            evening lectures at Accra Polytechnic (now Accra Technical
            University) after closing early from work. He had his private
            practice by name Offei Koram and Associates where he offered me
            practical training in Auditing for two years. In 1981, I enrolled
            for a Diploma in Accounting course programme at the University of
            Ghana after which he made me stay at his Boys Quarters at East
            Cantonments where he currently resides. Paa Offei as he is popularly
            known and called in the Koram family has indeed been a father to me
            since our first encounter in 1979. With his support, care and good
            counsel, I became a Chartered Accountant eventually and retired as a
            Chief Accountant of the Produce Buying Company Ltd in April 2017. I
            thank in God in no small measure for the impact he used Paa Offei to
            make in my life. Paa Offei God should continually bless you. Papa,
            Kwame who you call and always introduce to people as your son loves
            ❤ you. Paa Offei as I have known him loves God so much that, he
            extends such love to anyone around him. Papa does not play with his
            Church Service especially on Sundays. A committed Christian, that I
            can attest to. He used to share with me some words of wisdom and or
            philosophy which l cannot finish this piece without making reference
            to them. The first is, 'Anaatε anaamε, anaamε anaatε' (The Gas can
            help with interpretation) The second, 'Sε mεyε obi bone de, obi mmom
            nyε me bone' (translated thus, 'for him to wrong someone, he rather
            prefers to be wronged by someone) In conclusion, Papa as I
            personally call him is a man with a good heart and has made a
            positive influence in my life. All I can add is to wish Paa Offei
            the Good Lord's continuous blessings. Paa Offei, I love you greatly
            for all you have done for me. Kwame Frimpong.

            District Minister of Kaneshie Presbyterian Church, where Ackork was
            his treasurer accepted me into his home at East Cantonments and took
            very goo`d care of me until I completed my classes at Labone
            Secondary School. Ackork would give me weekly stipends and would
            also check that, I had eaten every day. He would again make sure
            that; I was safe and comfortable in order not to feel homesick. When
            he was free, he would talk to us about real life experiences which
            would teach us lessons for the future. I also enjoyed his good sense
            of humour. The way he would talk to you in typical Akuapem Twi –
            i.e., accent and intonation would make you laugh sometimes. In spite
            of his strictness, he is as well a man one wants to be with. His
            words of wisdom and humour make us always want us to be with him. To
            add to this his strictness will let you do away with any bad company
            / thing that you may encounter. Ackork would make sure that Church
            activities – forenoon service, revival service or anything related
            to special programmes in Kaneshie Presby Church were not forgotten.
            Despite the distance, all the way from East Cantonments to Kaneshie,
            Ackork would not shirk the responsibility of attending such services
            / programmes. I cannot forget Ackork’s love for music and for that
            matter playing of musical instruments. Papa E. O. Koram, aka Ackork,
            I thank God Almighty for your life, the immerse contribution you

            God. He always teaches the way of God. I have worked with him for
            over 10 years, and I have never been offended by him. Papa is a good
            man and may God keep him blessed always.

            Papa is a great man. I lived with Papa and family for many years. He
            was good to me loving me and showing no discrimination at all. As
            children when we were sick, he was so supportive ensuring that we
            got the best of medical care pampering us to ensure we took all our
            medicine. When I had my first daughter whom we named Offeibea after
            Papa, he came all the way to Amasaman to see us. He played great
            tunes for us with his harmonica to the admiration of all. Thank you
            so much Papa for being such a wonderful father to me and to all
            around you. We pray the Lord keeps you blessed and healthy.

          <p>
            The Man E. O. Koram, I used to call him and now I call him Papa
            Koram.
            <br />
            I first got to know Papa Koram about 40 years, when I was privileged
            to learn from him as an accountant in training. Papa trained me in
            financial and Christian virtues. His strict virtues, coupled with
            his brilliance in his field of study - a Chartered Accountant, made
            me stay with him at the PCG Head offices for many years despite
            ‘mouth-watering’ offers from some financially endowed companies. He
            impressed upon me that one’s Christian values should lead him in
            whatever work he does.
            <br />
            I can boldly say that my Christian values were greatly enhanced when
            I came under his tutolage. Papa Koram, God continue to bless you
            with many more years in good health. He then said he would give me a
            job to do (privately) to have some pocket money and also to give me
            a letter to register with the Institute of Chartered Accountants
            Ghana (ICAG) and attend evening lectures at Accra Polytechnic (now
            Accra Technical University) after closing early from work. He had
            his private practice by name Offei Koram and Associates where he
            offered me practical training in Auditing for two years. In 1981, I
            enrolled for a Diploma in Accounting course programme at the
            University of Ghana after which he made me stay at his Boys Quarters
            at East Cantonments where he currently resides. Paa Offei as he is
            popularly known and called in the Koram family has indeed been a
            father to me since our first encounter in 1979. With his support,
            care and good counsel, I became a Chartered Accountant eventually
            and retired as a Chief Accountant of the Produce Buying Company Ltd
            in April 2017. I thank in God in no small measure for the impact he
            used Paa Offei to make in my life. Paa Offei God should continually
            bless you. Papa, Kwame who you call and always introduce to people
            as your son loves ❤ you. Paa Offei as I have known him loves God so
            much that, he extends such love to anyone around him. Papa does not
            play with his Church Service especially on Sundays. A committed
            Christian, that I can attest to. He used to share with me some words
            of wisdom and or philosophy which l cannot finish this piece without
            making reference to them. The first is, 'Anaatε anaamε, anaamε
            anaatε' (The Gas can help with interpretation) The second, 'Sε mεyε
            obi bone de, obi mmom nyε me bone' (translated thus, 'for him to
            wrong someone, he rather prefers to be wronged by someone) In
            conclusion, Papa as I personally call him is a man with a good heart
            and has made a positive influence in my life. All I can add is to
            wish Paa Offei the Good Lord's continuous blessings. Paa Offei, I
            love you greatly for all you have done for me. Kwame Frimpong.

            To Ackork, <br />
            What an honour and a pleasure to share a few words on Ackork for his
            95th birthday! Not many of us could ever achieve such an impressive
            milestone. My first memories of Ackork date back to the early 1990s
            when I started Wesley Girls High School. In Form 1, Akua and I hit
            it off almost immediately, becoming the best of friends in a
            friendship that has lasted for more than 30 years. My most cherished
            memory of those early years was when Ackork and Akua visited my
            family in Takoradi during the long vacation. Ackork had come for a
            business trip and he brought Akua with him to visit us. I can still
            picture Ackork sitting and chatting with my parents on our veranda.
            Needless to say, Akua stayed with us for a few days and that
            vacation turned out to be one of the best school holidays of my
            life. Since then, Ackork has been a caring father figure towards me,
            always concerned about my health and well-being and always urging me
            to eat more whenever he felt I had lost weight. Cantonments is like
            a second home to me, and each time I visit, Ackork unwaveringly
            welcomes me with an “Obroni, Akwaaba” to which I systematically
            answer with my broken and wrong Twi, “Medaase” which always makes us
            laugh. Thank you Ackork for the kindness and love you have always
            shown to my family and myself. I wish you a Happy Blessed Birthday
            and I pray that we get together again for your 100th birthday.

            Uncle Offei became an integral part of our lives when he married our
            mother’s younger sister (Auntie Abena) in 1975. He has been a
            fabulous uncle in every way. I, Lucy, personally, remember spending
            holidays with Auntie Abena and Uncle Offei at their home in Labone,
            and later East Cantonments. I used to be spoilt rotten. It was great
            to travel around Accra, chauffeured in Uncle Offei’s posh
            Mercedes-Benz (I believe that car is still going strong to this
            day!). As Uncle Offei worked at the Cocoa Marketing Board, he made
            sure we were never short of all the different varieties of Golden
            Tree Chocolate. We really appreciated being able to enjoy and share
            these treats with our family and friends. Over the years Uncle Offei
            has been a steadfast rock to us all. He is witty, funny,
            encouraging, wise and loving. Following Auntie Abena’s death in 2008
            and Mummy falling ill in 2018, Uncle Offei has continued to take a
            keen interest in our comings and goings and in our general
            well-being. Despite his mobility difficulties, Uncle Offei is always
            happy to take time to travel all the way to Tema to visit Mummy, sit
            and pray with her and entertain her by playing hymn tunes on his
            mouth-organ. We wish our dear Uncle Offei a happy 95th birthday. We
            pray he has many more happy and healthy years and that he continues
            to look as young as ever. (He looks exactly the same as he did 50
            years ago!). We thank God for Uncle Offei’s long life and may the
            Lord continue to shower blessings on him. From the Coker siblings-
            Lucy Kyei-Mensah, Nicky Coker, Esi Cleland, Chief Coker and Nana

            Mr. Koram, as we affectionately refer to him, has always been like a
            father to me. He reminds me of my own father, who was also his
            colleague, friend and a brother. Mr. Koram’s Christian faith and
            unique positive approach to life helped me tremendously to run my
            institution His amazing sense of humour was always a reminder not to
            take life too seriously. Behind every story he told, despite the
            humour and laughter, there was always a lesson to take away. Indeed
            a man loaded with godly wisdom Mr. Koram, is an honourable man of
            great integrity, very principled and down to earth. He inspired me
            greatly with his hard working abilities. Meeting him in his office
            in his 80s and still working then, was admirable and encouraging.
            Mr. Koram, I thank God for your life. I would like to take this
            opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to you for going beyond
            your professional support to my institution and always being so
            caring, ready to assist, to inspire and to encourage and for being a
            good father figure to me. You are a great man Mr. Koram, and you
            deserve the best. May the Good Lord continue to bless you with good
            health, long life, peace, joy and grace for many more birthdays.

            It would take me a month to describe Papa. I met Papa when I was
            about 16 years and he has shown be great love since. He believes in
            nyonko d⊃ biako yɛ. I lived with Papa and his wife they supported me
            so well enven during my preganancy and delivery. They made sure that
            the baby and I had all I needed. His sister Auntie Ama was very
            supportive thoughought my preganancy and delivery. He is caring to a
            fault caring for all irrespective of where one comes from. In their
            home, they would always ask if we had eaten. This is the reason why
            I come back to live with Papa and family when he lost his wife
            almost 15 years ago. I will be forever grateful to Papa. I pray for
            good health to his last day. Even in his old age, Papa was still
            giving us money each time we visited. We wish he was still as young.
            W⊃fa, my devout Christian, indefatigable worker, quick at errand and
            reliable friend, happy 95th birthday. We pray for longer life in
            good health and prosperity. Amen.
