          <p>
            He had his primary education at the Mamfe Presbyterian Primary
            School, continuing to Akropong Senior School (Salem), where he made
            some lifelong friends. After that, Emmanuel went to Accra Academy
            Secondary School where he obtained the Cambridge School Leaving
            Certificate in 1948 and the London Matriculation Certificate in
            1949. <br />

            Commerce in London, where he successfully passed the Intermediate
            Examination of Association of International Accountants in June

          <h1 class="navyBg">Work Experience</h1>
          <p>
            Before heading off to the UK to start his accountancy course,
            Emmanuel taught at the Suhum Presbyterian Senior School from January
            1949 to March 1950. This was followed by a spell at HM Customs and
            Excise where he rose from an Officer to Executive Officer over the
            course of a few years from April 1950 to September 1953. <br />
            After returning from London, Emmanuel joined the Cocoa Marketing
            Company Ghana Limited in 1960 as their Chief Accountant in October
            1960 and remained with them until December 1975. <br />
            Following this, he was the Managing Director of the Cocoa Processing
            Company from 1977 to 1978 before becoming the Director of Finance at
            the Cocoa Marketing Board (COCOBOD).
            <br />
            In February 1980, Emmanuel joined the Presbyterian Church of Ghana
            as the Treasurer (this position is now known as Director of Finance)
            and served the church in that position till December 1988.
            Additionally, he was the Board Chairman for the Presbyterian Book
            Depot for some years during his period with the church. <br />
            From 1989 to 2001, Emmanuel was a Financial Consultant at Vanguard
            Assurance Company Limited, before successfully running his own
            accountancy firm (Emmanuel Koram & Associates) for many years.
            During this period he supported numerous clients from a variety of
            industries with their financial affairs until his retirement in
            2012.

          <h1 class="navyBg">Family Life</h1>
          <p>
            Emmanuel Koram married the late Abena Amponsah in May 1975 and they
            were blessed with two daughters, Afua Aseidua and Akua Amponsaa, who
            were his pride and joy. <br />
            He was a great unifier and a wonderful brother, uncle and
            grandfather to all who knew him and always gladly participated in
            all family events throughout his life. <br />
            As a dedicated follower of Christ, he made it a point to introduce
            anyone who stayed with him to Christianity and showed affection,
            love and compassion to everyone and at all times, irrespective of
            one’s creed, tribe, gender or age. <br />
            He loved the Lord and few days before his passing asked one of his
            nieces if she knew of any relatives who did not know the Lord so
            that he would speak to them about Jesus. He told her tell any such
            person that Jesus is alive.
            <br />
            Generous to a fault with his time, wisdom and financially; nothing
            was a problem to Papa Offei as he made everyone feel at home.

          <h1 class="navyBg">Other activities</h1>
          <p>
            Papa Offei (who became affectionately known as Ackork (Akokora) a
            nickname given to him by his daughters) was extremely witty. The
            jokes came so readily to him that people said he was a Fante
            ‘concert’ man from Mamfe. He was always a joy to be with and both
            children and adults loved being in his company. <br />
            His constant positive spirit and focus on God helped him navigate
            life’s challenges and he advised others to do the same 6 In Loving
            Memory of EMMANUEL O. KORAM when they encountered difficulties in
            their lives.
            <br />
            He took great delight in worshipping God through his love of music
            and was a gifted musician who played the flute during his school
            years before learning the guitar, double bass, and harmonica later
            in his life. Fortunately, he was able to play his harmonica until
            his dying day. <br />
            As a skillful driver and patient teacher, he taught numerous people
            how to drive by providing encouragement and help, especially to
            those who were fearful about getting behind the wheel again after an
            accident. <br />
            His willingness to serve others also led him the Rotary Club where
            he followed their motto ”Service above self” all the days of his
            life. <br />
            His love of photography enabled him to capture hundreds of pictures
            of friends and family that created treasured memories for many,
            especially in the days before smart phones. <br />
            His passion for his career and desire to help others attain
            knowledge led him to mentor and train several trainee accountants as
            well as support the Institute of Chartered Accountant, Ghana as a
            tutor and an examiner.

            Emmanuel Koram was a member of the Hour of Visitation Choir and
            Evangelistic Association (HOVCEA) and accompanied the choir with his
            double bass for many years.
            <br />
            Papa Koram worshiped the Kaneshie Presbyterian Church from the early
            1970s and attended church services religiously till the end. Even
            when he was weak and frail, he insisted on going to church to
            worship his maker. We remember with delight and thankfulness to God
            all his dance moves while the singing band sang “Me ne Nyame n’ɛnam
            ɔka me ho nti me nsuro” during the last church service he attended
            on the 19th March 2023. <br />
            He served at Kaneshie Presbyterian Church in various roles including
            patron of the Youth Choir, Patron of the Singing Band and a member
            of the Bible Study and Prayer Group. He was Head of Finance of the
            Congregation at the church for many years and the Congregation
            recognized him by naming the Finance Office after him (now known as
            “E. O. Koram Office”). <br />
            Additionally, he was a life long supporter of the Presbyterian
            Church of Ghana in Mamfe (his hometown), which the members
            appreciated and several even visited him a few days before he was
            taken ill and passed away on the 5th April 2023. <br />
            We celebrate his godly life and love of service which will live on
            for generations to come. We acknowledge his great works in our
            lives. We give thanks for his long and fruitful life. We take solace
            in his relationship with the Lord and the fact that he is resting
            peacefully in God’s everlasting majesty until we meet again.
