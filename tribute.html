              It had been extremely wonderful to have had Emmanuel Offei Koram
              as our father. Though he is no longer here with us we have such
              great memories of the wonderful times we shared, that it seems as
              though he is still near us. Our dad was a truly amazing man. He
              was exceptionally warm to all who came into contact with him
              irrespective of age or background. <br />
              Being a reputable Chartered Accountant, he was a very busy person
              but he always made time to perform his fatherly duties. This
              included him getting us coconut juice from the coconut trees in
              our backyard, making us orange juice, driving us to Bus Stop for
              meat pies and other goodies, travelling to different parts for the
              country including Bawku and further places and sponsoring our
              trips outside the country. <br />
              He would drive us to school in Saltpond and Cape Coast and visit
              us during the term. All our friends were his friends and called
              him Ackork, short form of Akokora, a name we had given him. br He
              taught us, till the last day, to trust in God and believe that all
              that happened was according to God’s plan. He encouraged us to
              keep worshipping God all our lives. He taught us to live our lives
              with great integrity and commitment to work to be successful in
              life.
              <br />
              When we lost our mother 15 years ago, Ackork was a real pillar in
              our lives though he was 80 years then. With support from his late
              sister, Auntie Ama, he supported us very well to recover from the
              shock of losing a Mum. <br />
              He helped us raise our four children pampering them when necessary
              but guiding them to do the right thing at all times. <br />
              For all these we say thank you to our dear Ackork, our legend.

                Dear Daddy, as stubborn as I was, I am ever so grateful for
                everything you did for me. I hope you have peaceful rest where
                you have departed to with love. I will miss you my top
                Ackork.</i

              <i
                >Ackork, thank you for grooming me to become a Chartered
                Accountant by age 23. Thank you for being my driving instructor
                and for all the driving tips you gave me till our last ride
                together. “Then I heard a voice from heaven say, “Write this:
                Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.” “Yes,”
                says the Spirit, “they will rest from their labour, for their
                deeds will follow them.” Rev. 14:13 8 In Loving Memory of
                EMMANUEL O. KORAM I still remember you that Wednesday afternoon
                by my bedside in the hospital, during the week of the
                Presbyterian Church of Ghana 1985 Synod. You dashed down from
                Agogo to come and see me. We will never forget you Papa, your
                memory will live on forever, though you are gone.</i

              <br />
              <br />
              May the good Lord grant you the well deserved rest. Amen.

              Grandpa, until we meet again, we want you to know that; even
              though your death leaves our hearts ache, the love you shared
              leaves a memory in our hearts. You are loved beyond words and you
              are missed beyond measure. <br />
              Your soft smile was a representation of your warm hearted persona.
              Despite you not being here with us today, the comfort you made me
              feel will never leave our side. <br />
              Throughout the years, you proved to be a caring Grandpa, always
              asking us ‘’W’adidi?”. We will never forget you shopping for our
              goodies. You were our advocate and we were certain of your support
              each time we reported our parents to you for not granting our
              wishes. An amicable solution was assured. Your words were always
              reassuring and comforting. <br />
              We remember your numerous jokes as well as advice you gave to us.
              We say a big thank you to God for making it possible for us to
              share all these great moments. <br />
              We thank you Grandpa! We love you Grandpa! We miss you Grandpa!
              Rest peacefully in the Lord.
              <br /><br />
              Amen.

            </h1>

            <p class="drop-cap">
              P apa, though we met two decades ago, it feels like a lifetime,
              since God brought you into my life. My joy knew no bounds when you
              allowed me to marry your lovely daughter Kuukuwaa, who you
              affectionately called Amponsaa. Papa, when you came into my life,
              I gained another father. You took me under your wing, embracing me
              into the family and making me feel as comfortable and at ease as
              possible. I know that you saw me as one of your own, and for that,
              I am eternally grateful. <br />
              Kuukuwaa and I left our home in Sakumono and moved in with you
              when your wife Ab passed away in 2008. It was a very good decision
              to move in with you because we were there for each other. You
              helped us raise our children, Afrakoma, Offeibea and Kwaku. I will
              keep the promise I made that Amponsaa and I will continue to bring
              up the children in the fear of The Lord. <br />
              We will miss the sweet melodies you made with your harmonica. We
              know you are now playing your heavenly harmonica with the Angels.
              You were kind and generous to a fault. We shall never forget your
              good works and kind deeds. You sincerely loved the Lord and you
              were a passionate soldier in God’s Army. We are comforted because
              you have fought a good fight, won the race and kept the faith and
              now a crown of righteousness awaits you in heaven. <br />
              Papa, goodnight. We shall meet on the resurrection morning with
              our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
              <br />
              <br />
              Amen.
