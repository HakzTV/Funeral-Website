              It had been extremely wonderful to have had Emmanuel Offei Koram
              as our father. Though he is no longer here with us we have such
              great memories of the wonderful times we shared, that it seems as
              though he is still near us. Our dad was a truly amazing man. He
              was exceptionally warm to all who came into contact with him
              irrespective of age or background. <br />
              Being a reputable Chartered Accountant, he was a very busy person
              but he always made time to perform his fatherly duties. This
              included him getting us coconut juice from the coconut trees in
              our backyard, making us orange juice, driving us to Bus Stop for
              meat pies and other goodies, travelling to different parts for the
              country including Bawku and further places and sponsoring our
              trips outside the country. <br />
              He would drive us to school in Saltpond and Cape Coast and visit
              us during the term. All our friends were his friends and called
              him Ackork, short form of Akokora, a name we had given him. br He
              taught us, till the last day, to trust in God and believe that all
              that happened was according to God’s plan. He encouraged us to
              keep worshipping God all our lives. He taught us to live our lives
              with great integrity and commitment to work to be successful in
              life.
              <br />
              When we lost our mother 15 years ago, Ackork was a real pillar in
              our lives though he was 80 years then. With support from his late
              sister, Auntie Ama, he supported us very well to recover from the
              shock of losing a Mum. <br />
              He helped us raise our four children pampering them when necessary
              but guiding them to do the right thing at all times. <br />
              For all these we say thank you to our dear Ackork, our legend.

                Dear Daddy, as stubborn as I was, I am ever so grateful for
                everything you did for me. I hope you have peaceful rest where
                you have departed to with love. I will miss you my top

              <i
                >Ackork, thank you for grooming me to become a Chartered
                Accountant by age 23. Thank you for being my driving instructor
                and for all the driving tips you gave me till our last ride
                together. “Then I heard a voice from heaven say, “Write this:
                Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.” “Yes,”
                says the Spirit, “they will rest from their labour, for their
                deeds will follow them.” Rev. 14:13 8 In Loving Memory of
                EMMANUEL O. KORAM I still remember you that Wednesday afternoon
                by my bedside in the hospital, during the week of the
                Presbyterian Church of Ghana 1985 Synod. You dashed down from
                Agogo to come and see me. We will never forget you Papa, your
                memory will live on forever, though you are gone.</i

              May the good Lord grant you the well deserved rest. Amen.

              Grandpa, until we meet again, we want you to know that; even
              though your death leaves our hearts ache, the love you shared
              leaves a memory in our hearts. You are loved beyond words and you
              are missed beyond measure. <br />
              Your soft smile was a representation of your warm hearted persona.
              Despite you not being here with us today, the comfort you made me
              feel will never leave our side. <br />
              Throughout the years, you proved to be a caring Grandpa, always
              asking us ‘’W’adidi?”. We will never forget you shopping for our
              goodies. You were our advocate and we were certain of your support
              each time we reported our parents to you for not granting our
              wishes. An amicable solution was assured. Your words were always
              reassuring and comforting. <br />
              We remember your numerous jokes as well as advice you gave to us.
              We say a big thank you to God for making it possible for us to
              share all these great moments. <br />
              We thank you Grandpa! We love you Grandpa! We miss you Grandpa!
              Rest peacefully in the Lord.
              <br /><br />
              Amen.

              Papa, though we met two decades ago, it feels like a lifetime,
              since God brought you into my life. My joy knew no bounds when you
              allowed me to marry your lovely daughter Kuukuwaa, who you
              affectionately called Amponsaa. Papa, when you came into my life,
              I gained another father. You took me under your wing, embracing me
              into the family and making me feel as comfortable and at ease as
              possible. I know that you saw me as one of your own, and for that,
              I am eternally grateful. <br />
              Kuukuwaa and I left our home in Sakumono and moved in with you
              when your wife Ab passed away in 2008. It was a very good decision
              to move in with you because we were there for each other. You
              helped us raise our children, Afrakoma, Offeibea and Kwaku. I will
              keep the promise I made that Amponsaa and I will continue to bring
              up the children in the fear of The Lord. <br />
              We will miss the sweet melodies you made with your harmonica. We
              know you are now playing your heavenly harmonica with the Angels.
              You were kind and generous to a fault. We shall never forget your
              good works and kind deeds. You sincerely loved the Lord and you
              were a passionate soldier in God’s Army. We are comforted because
              you have fought a good fight, won the race and kept the faith and
              now a crown of righteousness awaits you in heaven. <br />
              Papa, goodnight. We shall meet on the resurrection morning with
              our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

            <p class="drop-cap">
              AGYAKUMA Paa Offei, <br /><br />
              It is with mixed feelings that I write this short tribute to your
              memory. <br />
              We all knew we would face this day one day and yet we were not
              prepared to part with you. How selfish of us. When you asked me a
              week before crossing over to the other side whether the time had
              come for you to go, I emphatically said No. You then asked me how
              I knew the time had not come and I said God had not said so. He
              spared you for us for just another week. All these memories keep
              flooding back but my greatest joy is that like Job in the Old
              Testament, you never once asked why you were ill or in pain.
              <br />
              You kept the faith till the end and as God’s obedient servant you
              followed him to the other side when He touched you and asked you
              to follow him. A few days before your passing you asked me whether
              I was aware of anybody who did not know Christ- ‘Kristo’ I said no
              but you still asked this twice then told me that if I knew of any
              such person I should tell him/ her that Christ is alive and he/she
              should seek Him. I knew then that you had had an encounter with
              the Lord and it would not be long before you went to him. <br />
              You were my father before I met you since I only knew you by name
              when I was a little girl. <br />
              My earliest memory of you was when you sent me my first
              ‘Abrokyiri’ shoes one Christmas when I was only six years of age.
              In my little mind I formed my own opinion and image of you as a
              gentle kind-hearted man who loved me. <br />
              I thank God that I was not proved wrong in any way as you became
              my second dad when I eventually met you. Most of my friends knew
              you as my dad and even went on to say I looked like you. You
              treated some of them who came home to spend holidays with me as
              part of the family and for this I’m very grateful. <br />
              You were a true giver, a teacher, a friend and a great counsellor
              who believed in righteousness and fair play. You taught me to
              depend solely on God for every situation I face in life as he
              alone can solve every problem and I thank you for this. <br />
              I thank you for teaching me how to save and how to budget well. My
              tears never moved you when I wanted to overspend and you would not
              allow me to do so. Looking back now it has become one of my
              greatest assets. <br />
              We thank God for your life and for the fact that when the time was
              up you slipped away gently. We miss you dearly but know that the
              heavenly angels are rejoicing and leading you to your maker.
              <br />
              AGYAKUMA, PAA OFFEI. I bid you farewell. Rest peacefully with your
              maker till we meet again.

              What can I say? This verse encapsulates who you were to us, the
              Addo family. <br />
              My earliest recollection of you is hearing stories from our
              parents about life in England when you were students. We recall
              stories of our big brother Kwadwo, of blessed memory, asking you
              to play with him in all the ways toddlers do. Browsing through the
              family album, we saw pictures of you and our dear father, smartly
              dressed. You were an example of kindness, warmth and integrity for
              our family. When our father passed, you visited our home in Labone
              to check on us daily. We were grateful for the counsel you
              provided in the years that followed. Therefore, I made it a point
              to come and visit you each time I was in Ghana. You played
              “Amazing Grace” on the harmonica during my last visit. That was an
              extraordinary moment! <br />
              Thank you, dear Uncle, for the care and love you have shared with
              us all. Rest well in the Lord. <br />

            </h1>

            <p class="drop-cap">
              Fifty-three years ago, you came into our life as our God-given
              father when our biological father left for Britain to study Law.
              Nurturing us at very young age, not even in our teens, you
              inculcated in us the reading of the bible by bringing us that big
              Children’s Bible with pictures and said to us “the fear of the
              Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” Your monthly visits to us
              checking on how we were progressing whilst living with our mother
              is always remembered by her. She says a big THANK YOU AND GOD GIVE
              YOU ETERNAL REST. <br />

              Ackork, you gave us a feel of belongingness by sending us to Aburi
              Presbyterian Boys’ Boarding School (Amanfo) and then to Adisadel
              College. We counted ourselves as one of the fortunate few who were
              being chauffeured to school and visited in a Mercedes Benz. What
              else will a biological father do for his children which you didn’t
              go beyond? Your life and principles on this earth was a trademark
              to us and had made us successful in life. Looking at you on your
              sick bed the night of your departure, we couldn’t imagine you were
              on your way (with all your sense of humour) to your Maker. You
              will forever remain in our hearts till we meet again.
              <br /><br />
              Papa, nantew Yiyɛ!.

              God knows why he brought you to this world and indeed you didn’t
              disappoint Him. I know you touched many hearts but you touched me
              specially. I cannot list all the positive ways you impacted my
              life but I will mention a few. You had a good heart. <br />
              In 1979, after 6th Form I came into contact with you. Our
              interactions made me progress to become a Chartered Accountant.
              Aside from that I had the opportunity to live in your house and
              you considered me as a son even though you had no biological sons.
              You were a lovely father to the extent that you attended to my
              health needs. One day when I had severe malaria, he came to my
              room and realized I was in pain. He took me to the late Dr. Col.
              Anoff for treatment and I recovered. <br />
              On another occasion, after an operation at The Trust hospital in
              2011, I needed some special medication. As East Cantonments was
              close to The Trust Hospital, I called the house for assistance.
              Papa was home alone but took upon himself to drive out for the
              medication, this saved me greatly. <br />
              Papa is leaving us today physically as God has called him to give
              him a special place in the high heavens but he will forever remain
              in our hearts.

              Mr. Emmanuel Offei Koram was one of the most caring and loving
              patients I had. As his physiotherapist, he treated me like his own
              son; asking about my family and was always concerned about their
              welfare. He would speak to me in a low voice asking “has Amponsaa
              settled you?” <br />
              It was not just about the treatment I gave him, but he also showed
              me fatherly love and that made me always look forward to any
              appointment we had. Furthermore he was ever ready for physio and
              very responsive to our sessions. <br />
              If we humans had our way, we would do anything possible to have
              you back with us but God knows best. May the good Lord keep you
              close in his bosom until we meet again. Amen.

            </h1>
            <p class="drop-cap">
              I received the news about the Home Going of our dear brother Mr.
              E. O. Koram with the feeling that his life, was well lived to the
              glory of God. <br />
              Mr. Koram was one of the first Ghanaians I met when I first came
              to Ghana in 1968 as an American missionary working with the Eden
              Revival Church in Kokomlemle. Brother Koram was a dedicated member
              of the Eden Revival Church. <br />
              The Church had a great effect on many of the members because of
              some of the unbiblical teachings at that time. Brother Koram was a
              double bass player at Eden Revival Church. As the Word of God was
              preached, a lot of its members gave themselves to Christ. Brother
              Koram had a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ.
              <br />
              When I became Director and Executive Director of HOVCEA, Brother
              Koram became our double bass player. My first experience in
              relation to Ghanaian culture, was being invited to dinner at
              Brother Koram’s home where I was exposed to kenkey and hot pepper
              in my soup, as well as oily food. <br />
              Since I first came to Ghana in 1968, I have fond memories of
              Brother Koram. He was a very quiet man who truly was a loving
              disciple of Christ. He was a man of a few words. He was principled
              and a loving brother who would do anything for the body of Christ
              in Ghana and beyond. I am sure that our Brother Koram is in the
              presence of the Lord with all the saints in heaven waiting to
              receive their glorified bodies in the New Jerusalem, the city of
              God. <br />
              My memories of Brother Koram are only pleasant and joyful. “What
              more can he say to you who to Jesus have fled to Jesus our ransom
              our Saviour and Lord. Our master and friend”.

              Tribute from the
              <span class="navyBg"> Presbyterian Church of Ghana</span>
            </h1>
            <p class="drop-cap">
              It is with a heavy heart that we bid farewell to Mr. E.O. Koram, a
              man who served the Presbyterian Church of Ghana with distinction
              and dedication. His passing leaves a void in the Church and in the
              hearts of all who knew him. <br />
              Mr. E. O. Koram, who was affectionately called Papa Koram, was
              appointed Treasurer of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana in
              February, 1980 and ended his tenure in December 1988. Mr. Koram,
              took over from Mr. Harry Odoi, a former Auditor General of Ghana,
              who was then acting as the Church's Treasurer. <br />
              Mr. Koram took up the appointment at a time when the Church was in
              dire need of a Chartered Accountant to continue with the work of
              his predecessors. He initially worked on part-time basis but later
              had to forgo the lucrative position that he was occupying to
              respond to the Master’s call in the Church that he loved so much.
              <br />
              Mr. Koram introduced many reforms to the Church’s Finance
              Department and the Church’s financial management systems. The late
              Mr. G.Y. Odoi, the then Chairman of the Central Finance Committee,
              in his report to Synod in August 1981, held at Abetifi, has this
              to say about the man E. O. Koram:
              <i
                >“Since the appointment of Mr. E.O. Koram as the Treasurer, the
                quality of the accounting work has improved a lot”.</i
              >
              <br />
              Mr. Koram was a founding member of the Presbyterian Foundation, an
              initiative by PCG to raise Seed Money for the Church’s
              Evangelistic, Developmental and Social Activities. He also served
              as Chairperson of the Presbyterian Book Depot Ltd., where he,
              together with the Board brought vibrancy into the operations of
              the Book Depot. <br />
              Papa Koram was a regular member of the team that represented PCG
              at its Triennial Consultations with its Ecumenical and
              Developmental Partners in the Netherlands, Germany, United
              Kingdom, and the United States of America among many other
              countries, during his tenure as the Church’s Treasurer. <br />
              The experienced Chartered Accountant that he was, he managed the
              Church’s finances with integrity and ensured that every money
              taken was accounted for. During the times when the flow of money
              to the church office was very irregular, he managed the funds
              available cautiously. He would frankly tell you “sika nni hɔ”
              (meaning there is no money) and he was nicknamed “sika nni hɔ”
              <br />
              Mr. Koram, nonetheless, had a soft heart towards workers at the
              head office. He freely, gave out his personal money to those who
              mustered the courage to approach him with a convincing case.
              <br />
              Mr. Koram was also an encourager and a good teacher. He prevailed
              upon workers in his Department to study towards qualification as
              Chartered Accountants. Normally on Saturdays, those who joined him
              at the office to work on issues that were outstanding were taken
              through tutorials in accounting and finance. He also used any
              opportunity he got to preach Christ to them, thus encouraging the
              staff to work faithfully as unto God and not for their personal
              gains. <br />
              Mr. E. O. Koram, Papa Koram, E.O., rest peacefully in your
              Saviour’s bosom! “Your good works shall follow you”.

              Tribute from the
              <span class="navyBg">
                Presbyterian Church of Ghana - Kaneshie Congregation</span
              >
            </h1>
            <p class="drop-cap">
              Today, we are gathered with a heavy heart but with total
              submission to the will of God to bid a final farewell to a devoted
              and dedicated Servant in God’s vineyard, our father, grandfather
              and son of our great Kaneshie Congregation. Our late brother in
              Christ, ex-Presbyter Papa Koram joined the congregation in the
              early seventies. He was a very active member and notwithstanding
              his calm disposition, involved himself in various activities in
              the Church. <br />
              For over four decades, he inspired and encouraged many in the Lord
              by his devotion. His distinguished stewardship was assuring, and
              we are confident that his exemplary service and commitment to the
              Church enabled him to show others the ways of the Lord who is our
              faithful Creator and Father of all. <br />
              His contributions towards Church activities and love for God’s
              work culminated in his election as Presbyter in 1983. During those
              days, there were no specific terms for members of Session. This
              made him serve as Presbyter till the year 2002 when the Church
              revised the terms of a Presbyter in the PCG. He became the
              Treasurer of the Congregation as well as that of the Kaneshie
              District Church Office. He worked with the following Ministers
              posted to Kaneshie and served them to the best of his ability.
              Rev. A. L Kwansa: 1978-1983, Rev. A.A. Beeko: 1983-1984, Rt. Rev.
              Dr. Sam Prempeh: 1984-1987, Rev. C. A. Ansa: 1987-1992, Rev. Prof.
              Emmanuel Martey: 1992-1994, Rev. Ernest Ayeh-Hanson: 1994-1996,
              Rev. Emmanuel Agyem-Frempong: 1996-2001, Rev. Dr. Isaac K. Fokuo:
              2001-2002. During this period, he helped to develop financial
              systems, procedures, checks and balances for the Church. He
              performed his roles as Treasurer over many years judiciously and
              the church never encountered any problems whatsoever with Auditors
              or Statutory bodies. <br />
              Papa Offei Koram had a passion for music. This was very evident in
              how he played both his harmonica accompaniments to Presbyterian
              Hymns as well as the double bass. His reserved seating place where
              this big musical instrument was always located will forever be
              remembered. <br />
              Having dedicated his life in the Lord’s vineyard in his youthful
              age, he continued to serve God by coming to Church on Sundays in
              the company of his daughter Akua Amponsaa and caregiver even when
              mobility was a bit of a challenge. He never wanted to be
              considered as a Housebound member and so availed himself when it
              was convenient. Papa’s conversations were centred on God and his
              faithfulness. His response anytime you enquired about his general
              wellbeing was “Me konkon ho. Mo Mpaebo no nti, me tease. Nyame
              ahwε me so”. How reassuring!!! We vividly remember two of such
              occasions; the first was his 95th milestone when his entire family
              joined him at Church which coincided with 2022 Traditional Sunday
              on 25 September 2022. <br />
              The second occurred on Sunday 26th February 2023, when the
              Moderator of the General Assembly, Rt. Rev Prof J. O. Y. Mante,
              was on official duties at the 50th Anniversary National
              Presbyters’ Conference. He met Papa Koram at the car park, when he
              was being ushered into a wheelchair by Akua. These were the kinds
              words Papa Moderator said of our late father. “Presbyterian Church
              da woase paa wo nea waye ama Asafo no. Nyame nhyira wo bebree”.
              <br />
              On the 19th March 2023, his last day at church, Papa Koram was so
              joyous and he danced to the glory of God raising his hands while
              the Singing Band performed during the offertory to one of Papa’s
              favourite tunes “Me ne Nyame na ɛnam”. It was as if he was bidding
              us farewell. <br />
              In God’s wisdom, it was time for him to go home and have his
              deserved rest. It came as a shock to many a church member when
              news regarding his demise was announced. Who are we to question
              God. He has granted him a full and fulfilled life and it is time
              to take the deserved rest. <br />
              Today, as we join the bereaved family, friends, and all to mourn
              our departed Brother-in-Christ. Ex-Presbyter E.O. Koram, we say
              ‘well done for your faithful service in the Lord’s vineyard’. May
              you find mercy and approval before our Father in heaven. <br />

              We pray that the grieving family, our sympathizers and all members
              of the Church will be consoled with the knowledge that the death
              of a man of God is never untimely and that our father, brother and
              grandfather now goes to his eternal Father who has prepared a
              place for him. May God continue to keep alive the memory of his
              devoted life of faith and service in our hearts!!!
              <br />
              <br />
              Amen.

              With deep sorrow but with thanksgiving to the Lord, the PCG
              Kaneshie Congregation BSPG takes consolation in our assured life
              in Christ as we pay tribute to an illustrious son in the Lord’s
              vineyard, the late Brother E. O. Koram, our beloved friend and
              dear Brother today. <br />
              The PCG Kaneshie Congregation BSPG has every good reason to be
              associated with the life of our dear Brother. He joined the Group
              in the early 1970’s after he had left the Late Yeboa Koree’s
              church. His selflessness and dedicated service contributed to the
              rapid growth of the Group. <br />
              Brother E. O. Koram loved the Lord and his joy was in serving the
              Lord. Due to his zeal and enthusiasm for the growth of the Group
              he was appointed to leadership positions in both the local Group
              and the district for several years. Indeed, at the celebration of
              the 50th anniversary of the Group in 2022, our dear Brother was
              one of only four people who were awarded citations and this is
              what the citation read: <br />
              <b>Bro. Emmanuel Offei Koram</b>
              <i
                >“Great in counsel and mighty indeed, for thine eyes are open
                upon all the ways of the sons of men to give everyone according
                to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings.” Jeremiah
                32:19 <br />
                When you joined the BSPG, Kaneshie Congregation some forty years
                ago, you did not come as a spectator but you immediately put on
                your working boots and got to work. You identified your calling
                and earnestly and wholeheartedly you engaged yourself in your
                Father’s business. <br />
                You challenged us with your zeal and enthusiasm and your spirit
                of giving. Yes, you had both the Great Commandment and the Great
                Commission at heart when you wasted no time in looking out for
                areas of need and quietly met those needs, without announcing
                yourself.
                <br />
                Bro. Koram, you are indeed a blessing to the family of God. In
                blessing, may you your descendants be overwhelmed with
                blessings, and may you never loose your testimony. <br

              <br />
              The words of the citation indicated that indeed our dear Brother
              was a worthy member of the Group, supporting the Group financially
              for members to go on evangelism on numerous occasions and also on
              other occasions when the need arose. <br />
              He taught the executive committee members good accounting
              practices and insisted that the Group’s money should not be kept
              by any member in his house (a common thing in earlier days) for
              more than two days but that the money should be sent to the bank.
              <br />
              Our dear departed Brother could best be described as a man with a
              good heart because he related very well with all members of the
              Group. He was a positive influence on the Group members, giving
              good advice about how to handle Session for Session to agree with
              some of their ideas at a time when the Presbyterian Church was
              kicking against certain norms of the Group like clapping of hands
              during prayer, speaking in tongues and falling under the influence
              of the Holy Spirit. These were strange to the Church in those days
              and for which reason there was no love lost between Session and
              the BSPG. He was a man of valour and a passionate and committed
              Christian, encourager and a motivator of Group members. He was a
              regular member, very active, until late 2015 when due to old age
              and the late time of meeting of the local Group he was no longer
              able to attend meetings. <br />
              As a believer, who died trusting the Lord, we know that our late
              Brother in Christ laboured for the Lord, whose acknowledgement and
              reward of eternal life will surely be his. We share in the
              family’s grief over the death of their father, brother, uncle and
              grandpa. We believe that we shall see him again when all the
              saints are called to meet our Father in heaven. <br />
              The entire PCG Kaneshie Congregation BSPG bid you farewell our
              beloved Brother. You will be fondly remembered by us. You have
              indeed fought a good fight. Gallant soldier of the Lord may your
              gentle soul find eternal rest in the Lord. Amen

              Tribute from the
              <span class="navyBg"> Kaneshie Singing Band </span>
            </h1>
            <p class="drop-cap">
              “Yes we believe Lord.” For Mr. E.O Koram, was a man passionate
              with singing band, not only with its songs but also with the
              welfare and development of the band. Mr. Koram was one of the
              early people to build the singing band. He was a member as well as
              a patron. So he did both the work of a patron as well as a member.
              His work in the Lord’s house attracted a friend of his, called Mr.
              Bampoe Pare. He voluntarily decided to also become a patron and
              these two formidable men became the band’s backbones. At this
              time, the Kaneshie Presby Church was behind the Kaneshie Market
              near the cemetery. “ In 1963, when the Kaneshie Presby singing
              band was about to be inaugurated, these two men thus, Mr. E.O.
              Koram and his friend were very key in their office as a patrons to
              help develop the singing band. <br />
              Also, in 1972 when the singing band improved to the extent that it
              used instruments for worship, which at that time was highly
              prohibited in the Presby Church. This led to the summoning of the
              band to Synod at Abetifi. It was the advices of Mr. E.O Koram, his
              friend Mr. Bampoe-Parry and Lawyer Offei who prepared the band to
              defend themselves before of the Synod. To God’s Glory the band was
              allowed to use these instruments. <br />
              Through this breakthrough, Mr Koram and his friend Bampoe-Parry,
              bought a double bass and ‘Konka’ for the singing band on their
              return journey from oversees. He dedicated time to teach all
              interested people and even at times hired instructors to support
              when he could not make it. He also played alongside during church
              services with his mouth organ which was his favourite instrument
              and used it to pitch. <br />
              Also during singing band conferences, Mr. Koram handled expenses
              related to food preparation where his wife would then deliver it
              and also advice the band to behave well as they are going and not
              to be eating people’s food anyhow. <br />
              All these things were not solo occurrences Mr. Koram did. In fact,
              he would always ask the band “Na mo kɔ so sεn” in order to find
              out the need of the band. This continued to a point the phrase
              became his title, “Na mo kɔ so sεn”. His presence in the formation
              of the singing band is deeply treasured, and as if not enough he
              dedicated time to advice new executives on financial matters and
              control of expenditure and proper management of funds. <br />
              Mr. Koram your absence has created a vacuum in us, yet our belief
              is that as the scriptures says, “by their works you shall know
              them” with joy we anticipate that you are in the Father’s Bosom
              now. May God be with you till we meet again.
              <br />
              DAMIRIFA DUE!
              <br />
              YONKODƆ! BIAKO YE!

              Tribute from 
              <span class="navyBg">The Hour of Visitation Choir and 
                Evangelistic Association (HOVCEA)</span>
            </h1>
            <p class="drop-cap">
              We are here today to celebrate the 
life of our beloved brother E.O. 
Koram whose existence impacted 
greatly the Hour of Visitation Choir and 
Evangelistic Association (HOVCEA) family, 
the Christian Community and Ghanaians in 
general. <br>
Our Brother E.O. Koram joined HOVCEA in 
the early 1970s and having received Jesus 
Christ as his Lord and personal Saviour 
through our weekly Radio Ministry, there 
was no turning back for him. He was a 
double bass player in the Choir. He was 
a man of few words and very faithful in 
action. Despite his very high position in the 
business community, he was very humble 
and treated all of us as his brothers and 
sisters. Brother Koram showed us what 
Christian love should look like. May his 
sweet soul rest in perfect peace. We send 
him off with the words of our popular 
HOVCEA anthem. <br>
<i>“There shall be showers of blessing: 
  This is the promise of love; There 
  shall be seasons refreshing, Sent 
  from the Saviour above. Showers 
  of blessing, Showers of blessing 
  we need; Mercy-drops round us 
  are falling, But for the showers we 
  plead.”</i>
  <br>
  The following are selected memories shared 
by individual HOVCEA members: <br>
<ol class="tribs">
  <li> Brother E.O. Koram was very friendly 
    and very ready to listen to anyone. 
    He was generous. I remember that 
    one time a HOVCEA brother had a 
    challenge getting a bridal car for his 
    wedding, which was scheduled for 
    the weekend. I called brother Koram, 
    made a last-minute request by asking 
    for his Mercedes-Benz. He asked, 
    “Who would be driving?” When he 
    heard the name of the driver, he said, 
    “Come for it.”</li>
  <li> My condolences to the Family of our 
    late Brother Koram. I gave our 1970 
    HOVCEA anniversary envelope to him 
    and he told me that he had listened to 
    our Radio Broadcast earlier and gave 
    his life to the Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
  <li>I will never forget this elderly Christian 
    at the Bible House, during one of 
    HOVCEA’s meetings, always carrying 
    his double bass. He played it very 
    well with distinction to add value to 
    HOVCEA’s music. This was as far back 
    as the early 1970’s. Hopefully, he will 
    join the Band in Heaven.</li>
  <li> I recall that the late Mr. Koram was 
    a key member of the HOVCEA Choir 
    and the Eldest among all the Pioneers, 
    with unquestionable zeal to proclaim 
    Christ’s Good news. He had a passion 
    for soul winning and always followed 
    the Choir with his Big Double Bass 
    Guitar (one-string) in his Mercedes Benz to rehearsals, Open Air Crusades, 
    HOVCEA Anniversaries, Church Revivals and Institutional Gospel 
    Rallies. One of them I vividly recall was 
    in the 1970s at the then Presbyterian 
    Training College (now hosting 
    Presbyterian College of Education; one 
    of the campuses of the Presbyterian 
    University College, Akropong Akuapem). He was unassuming, 
    disciplined, neatly dressed, soft spoken 
    and a man of few words. May his 
    gentle soul rest in perfect peace.</li>
  <li>HOVCEA family will always relish with 
    joy how in 2017 our beloved E.O. Koram 
    opened his home for a memorable 
    homecoming and fellowship programme 
    of HOVCEA family at virtually no cost 
    to HOVCEA. A thoughtful, kind elderly 
    Christian he was.
   </li>
   <li>Our wholehearted condolences to the 
    bereaved family. May God comfort 
    and strengthen them.</li>
   <li>Brother E.O. Koram gave me his 
    Mercedes-Benz one whole weekend 
    for my wedding celebrations in 1976. 
    I was relating this story just last week 
    to a friend, and he said Brother Koram 
    gave them the same Mercedes-Benz 
    for their wedding.</li>
</ol>
<br>

  TO OUR GREAT GOD AND FATHER, BE 
  ALL PRAISE AND GLORY FOR GIFTING US 
  BROTHER E. O. KORAM. AMEN!

              Tribute from 
              <span class="navyBg"> Rev. Michael Gabriel Anim-Tetey</span>
            </h1>
            <p class="drop-cap">I called him Papa Koram or Papa for short. 
              Papa was a father, mentor, boss, tutor, an 
              encourager, a disciple and role model. He 
              perfectly fitted into all these roles at the 
              same time. His sense of humour surpassed 
              all. Once you knew Papa Koram, at least, 
              one or more of the afore mentioned 
              virtues, got you glued to him. Papa joined 
              and led other veterans in the Accounting 
              profession to restructure and streamlined 
              the Presbyterian Church of Ghana finance 
              department into a robust department 
              which attracted other churches to learn 
              from the PCG Structure. <br>
              Papa trained the staff who worked under 
              him to become not only astute finance 
              professionals but trained them also to 
              become people of integrity. <br>
              Papa, your legacy is unsurpassed. <br>
              Rest in your Maker’s bosom.</p>

            <p class="drop-cap">T
              o commence business, the Cocoa 
              Marketing Company needed capital. 
              The company did not have any capital 
              and we did not want to borrow money 
              from the Bank of Ghana, the bank of last 
              resort. We therefore had to resort to a Sales 
              Policy. <br>
              The idea came from Wɔfa Koram, a 
              Chartered Accountant of England and 
              Wales, that we should charge a percentage 
              commission for the sales we would make 
              on marketing Ghana cocoa on the world 
              market. We came to an agreement that 
              we would charge 1/4 percent on all sales we 
              would make from time to time. We arrived 
              at a reasonable figure and obtained an 
              advance payment. <br>
              From this advance payment we were able 
              to pay salaries for our employees and pay 
              other recurring expenses. We were also able 
              to purchase residential properties for our 
              staff from the Ghana Housing Corporation 
              at Ringway Estates, North Labone and East 
              Cantonments. <br>
              The Sales Policy has been implemented by 
              the company during all these years and 
              credit goes to Messrs U.K. Hackman, E. O. 
              Koram (Wɔfa) and Martin Dwamena (the 
              only surviving member of the trio), who 
              devised the sales policy of the company. <br>
              Mr. E. O. Koram was a devout Christian 
              and whose Christian qualities came to bear 
              during our time together at the Cocoa 
              Marketing Company.</p>

              apa, I am grateful to God for bringing 
              me to your home though it was only 
              for 6 weeks. I prayed that God should 
              give you ten more years because I really 
              enjoyed working with you. I told God to 
              grant you more years so I could serve you 
              because you were a good man. <br>
              I had prayed to God for a good patient who 
              would love me, treat me well and make 
              my work comfortable. God granted my 
              request. You treated me with love. <br>
              We got attached to each other as soon 
              as we met. You commented that my 
              shirt looked good on me. You asked if I 
              had eaten. Your brother was called Alex 
              Okwaning Koram and I was called Alex. 
              That was the beginning of a relationship 
              that I will cherish for the rest of my life. You 
              took me as your own to the extent that 
              you would speak to my wife, Hilda, on the 
              phone to ensure that no girlfriend ‘jolley’ 
              was taking me away from her.  <br>
              I am still struggling to understand why 
              God took you away so quickly. I have been 
              really sad about your departure but I am 
              comforted because I know you are with 
              your maker. The last thing you said to me 
              was Nyame yɛ dɛ and I know you served 
              God till the end. 
              <br><br>

              Tribute from the 
              <span class="navyBg">Children of Mr. A. Bampoe-Parry</span>
            </h1>
            <p class="drop-cap">
              Legend has it that our great Mr. 
              Koram’s life was characterized by three 
              distinctive traits: God, Accounting and 
              Music. Please permit us to add a fourth 
              one: FRIENDSHIP. <br>
              Ask any of us who Dad’s best friend is/was, 
              and the unanimous answer will be, the 
              honourable Mr. Koram. Two Akuapem men 
              who although not biologically connected, 
              became the best of friends. Referring to 
              Mr. Koram as our father’s brother will not 
              be an overstatement. <br>
              Watching the two of them interact may 
              dispel the adage opposites attract. From 
              our point of view, they acted in very similar 
              ways. They worshiped together, (true 
              pioneers of Kaneshie Presby). Both actively 
              involved in the Singing Band. Rarely did 
              any of them make solo contributions to 
              support church activities. Donations and 
              contributions were always done under the 
              auspices of “my brother and I”. <br>
              Seeing both men wearing same pattern 
              cloth on certain occasions was not a 
              farfetched sight, even purchasing and 
              owning the same model vehicle at the 
              same time. If such acts were by design or 
              mere coincidence, inquiring minds will have 
              to wait till they meet the two “buddies” in 
              heaven. <br>
              Both men were known as distinguished 
              gentlemen, very introspective, soft 
              spoken with every word uttered with well 
              measured thoughts, mimicking Solomonic 
              tendencies.
              One hidden gem of Mr. Koram’s that we 
              appreciated was his sense of humour. A 
              very funny man indeed. Our conversations 
              were always laced with subtle humour. His 
              deliveries were always on point. <br>
              An unforgettable show of love and true 
              friendship was once again exhibited during 
              countless days of emotional and physical 
              support Mr. Koram shared grieving with his 
              friend (our Father) when he lost his beloved 
              wife. Such memories will be forever etched 
              in our thoughts. <br>
              The state of enduring affection and trust 
              that existed between you and Mr. Andrew 
              Bampoe-Parry carried on in more ways 
              than one till the very last day of your calling 
              to be with the Lord. We acknowledge and 
              thank you for all your efforts, deeds and 
              support. You have indeed taught us that 
              the word friendship is not a dormant word 
              but instead one of action. You lived it.
              <br>
              We can hear Daddy (your friend) saying 
              “Offei, w’aba?” (“Offei, are you here?”) 
              <br>
              Rest Well. You have fulfilled your purpose. 
              Job well done.
              <br>

           <p class="drop-cap">
            Papa Offei Koram, Papa Offei as we 
affectionately called him, was always 
part of our household. He was very 
close to my late Dad, Dr. Timothy Awuku-Asabre. We witnessed first hand the warm 
relationship between them. They spent 
many times together and shared a lot 
of jokes between them which brought 
instantaneous laughter. On one occasion 
when my parents went to Nuamakrom, 
Papa Offei showed his love and kindness 
by offering them his bedroom for the 
weekend, whilst he slept in the sitting 
room. <br>
It was always fun to be around Papa Offei; 
he had a good sense of humour. He made 
everyone feel welcome and comfortable 
around him. One of his numerous pieces of 
advice to us was to be sincere, upright and 
faithful at all times. He was a man of his 
word and lived by what he said. Papa Offei 
was sincere, pragmatic, hardworking, kind 
and humble. <br>
Papa Offei was a great storyteller. He told us 
lots of stories about events he experienced. 
On listening to him, one can compare his 
life to some biblical characters. <br>
Papa Offei was blessed with good health 
and long life. He overcame many of the 
challenges and ailments that came his way. 
We were grateful to grow closer to him 
during the later years of his life. <br>
At the age of 95 you looked strong and 
healthy. We all expected you to be with us 
for a longer period. You had an intervention, 
you recovered well but later your condition 
worsened. You fought bravely, but alas, 
you said “mbre no aso” (the end is nigh). It 
was time for you to go and rest. O death, 
where is your sting? Jesus Christ took the 
sting from death 2,000 years ago. <br>
Papa we know you are sleeping and on the 
resurrection morning, when the trump shall 
sound and the saints of God shall gather, 
we shall meet again at the Eastern Gate. <br>
Papa Offei rest, rest well in the bosom of 
Abraham.

           <p class="drop-cap">Heaven undoubtedly has gained 
            a saint, a saint we simply called 
            Grandpa. What a man he was. A 
            man who lived well and fought a great 
            fight. <br>
            Grandpa was a lot of things to us. He was our 
            music teacher and musician, our accounts 
            professor, our Bible teacher, Akuapem 
            Twi teacher, our refuge from scolding and 
            punishments and our favourite “sponsor” 
            for most things. We are sad because we will 
            never hear your inspirational voice, full of 
            jokes and wisdom. Neither will we hear you 
            play your instrument again, nor “sponsor” 
            our plans. We will no longer hear a “Well 
            done” or “Congratulations” from you on 
            our achievements. This pains our hearts 
            because an endorsement from Grandpa 
            meant the world to us. It is difficult to 
            admit we will never see you again. We have 
            indeed lost the greatest Grandfather. But, 
            we will rejoice and celebrate your legacy 
            because you have gone home to your 
            heavenly Father. Therefore, in our sadness, 
            we rejoice because you have gone home to 
            your maker and master who you served so 
            diligently. <br>
            Grandpa, please watch over us from 
            heaven as our new guardian angel. We 
            love you and you will forever live in our 
            hearts and memories till Christ returns for 
            his righteous servants. <br>
            Agya pa Papa Offei, da yie. <br>
